---

## 🤖 AI Service & Logic

### **Performance Analysis Engine**

#### **Metrics Calculation**
```typescript
// Consistency Score Algorithm
const calculateConsistency = (entries: ProgressEntry[]): number => {
  const practiceCount = entries.filter(e => e.netHours > 0).length;
  return (practiceCount / entries.length) * 100;
};

// Improvement Tracking
const calculateImprovement = (entries: ProgressEntry[]): number => {
  const recent = entries.slice(-3);
  const older = entries.slice(-6, -3);
  const recentAvg = recent.reduce((sum, e) => sum + e.selfRating, 0) / recent.length;
  const olderAvg = older.reduce((sum, e) => sum + e.selfRating, 0) / older.length;
  return ((recentAvg - olderAvg) / olderAvg) * 100;
};
```

#### **Feedback Generation Logic**
- **Rule-based analysis** of user performance patterns
- **Contextual feedback** based on consistency and improvement
- **Role-specific suggestions** for different cricket positions
- **Motivational content** to maintain engagement

### **Training Plan Generation**

#### **Role-Specific Drills**
- **Batsman**: Straight drives, cover drives, footwork drills
- **Bowler**: Line & length, yorkers, spin variations
- **All-Rounder**: Balanced batting, bowling, and fielding
- **Wicketkeeper**: Glove work, reflexes, batting techniques

#### **Difficulty Progression**
- **Easy**: Foundation skills and basic techniques
- **Medium**: Intermediate skills with increased complexity
- **Hard**: Advanced techniques and match scenarios

---

## 💾 Data Management

### **Local Storage Architecture**

#### **Storage Keys**
```typescript
const STORAGE_KEYS = {
  USER: 'cricdr_user',
  TRAINING_PLAN: 'cricdr_training_plan',
  PROGRESS: 'cricdr_progress',
  FEEDBACK: 'cricdr_feedback'
};
```

#### **Data Models**
- **User Profile**: Personal and cricket-specific information
- **Training Plans**: AI-generated drills and schedules
- **Progress Entries**: Daily training logs and metrics
- **Coach Feedback**: AI analysis and suggestions

#### **Data Persistence Strategy**
- **Automatic saving** on all user interactions
- **Error handling** for storage failures
- **Data validation** before persistence
- **Backup and recovery** mechanisms

### **Type Safety**

#### **TypeScript Interfaces**
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  age: number;
  role: 'Batsman' | 'Bowler' | 'All-Rounder' | 'Wicketkeeper';
  skillLevel: 'Beginner' | 'Intermediate' | 'Advanced';
  weeklyHours: number;
  fitnessGoal: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```
