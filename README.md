  <pre>

PHASE 1: User Onboarding & Profile Setup
═════════════════════════════════════════

Step 1: Initial Landing
• User visits the application
• Cricket-themed welcome screen is shown
• System checks localStorage for existing profile
• If no profile, user is guided to profile creation

Step 2: Profile Creation Process
• Validated form with structured inputs

Profile Form Fields:

## 🛠 Technology Stack

Frontend Framework
I built this project using React 18 with TypeScript, ensuring type safety and modern development practices. The entire application is structured as a Single Page Application (SPA) with component-based architecture.

Styling & Design System
For the visual design, I implemented Tailwind CSS as my primary styling framework. I chose Tailwind because it allows for rapid prototyping while maintaining consistency across components. I've created a custom design system with:

A cricket-themed color palette (emerald greens and blues)
Consistent spacing using an 8px grid system
Custom animations and micro-interactions
Responsive breakpoints for mobile-first design

### Build Tools & Development Environment
I'm using Vite as my build tool and development server, which provides:

Lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR)
Optimized production builds
Modern ES modules support
Excellent TypeScript integration

### Icons & Visual Elements
I integrated Lucide React for all iconography, providing a consistent and modern icon set throughout the application. For charts and data visualization, I implemented Chart.js with React-ChartJS-2 wrapper.


### **Frontend Framework**

## 🤖 AI Service & Logic

### **Performance Analysis Engine**

#### **Metrics Calculation**
```typescript
// Consistency Score Algorithm
const calculateConsistency = (entries: ProgressEntry[]): number => {
  const practiceCount = entries.filter(e => e.netHours > 0).length;
  return (practiceCount / entries.length) * 100;
};

// Improvement Tracking
const calculateImprovement = (entries: ProgressEntry[]): number => {
  const recent = entries.slice(-3);
  const older = entries.slice(-6, -3);
  const recentAvg = recent.reduce((sum, e) => sum + e.selfRating, 0) / recent.length;
  const olderAvg = older.reduce((sum, e) => sum + e.selfRating, 0) / older.length;
  return ((recentAvg - olderAvg) / olderAvg) * 100;
};
```

#### **Feedback Generation Logic**
- **Rule-based analysis** of user performance patterns
- **Contextual feedback** based on consistency and improvement
- **Role-specific suggestions** for different cricket positions
- **Motivational content** to maintain engagement

### **Training Plan Generation**

#### **Role-Specific Drills**
- **Batsman**: Straight drives, cover drives, footwork drills

- **All-Rounder**: Balanced batting, bowling, and fielding
- **Wicketkeeper**: Glove work, reflexes, batting techniques

#### **Difficulty Progression**
- **Easy**: Foundation skills and basic techniques
- **Medium**: Intermediate skills with increased complexity
- **Hard**: Advanced techniques and match scenarios

  Caches AI-generated feedback to improve performance and reduce API calls.

- **Data Serialization with Proper Date Handling**  
  Ensures consistent formatting and accurate parsing of dates across all stored data.


#### **Storage Keys**
```typescript
const STORAGE_KEYS = {
  USER: 'cricdr_user',
  TRAINING_PLAN: 'cricdr_training_plan',
  PROGRESS: 'cricdr_progress',
  FEEDBACK: 'cricdr_feedback'
};
```


### 🗂️ Data Architecture

My data architecture includes:

- **User-Centric Design**  
  All data is linked to unique user IDs, ensuring personalized experiences and secure data isolation.

  Maintains logical relationships between:
  - User profiles  
  - AI-generated training plans  
  - Progress logs and performance records  

- **Comprehensive Error Handling & Data Validation**  
  Validates all user inputs, training data, and logs with proper schema checks and error boundaries.

- **Backup & Recovery Mechanisms**  
  Implements strategies to ensure data durability and prevent loss in case of failure or refresh.

#### **Data Models**
- **User Profile**: Personal and cricket-specific information
- **Training Plans**: AI-generated drills and schedules
- **Progress Entries**: Daily training logs and metrics
- **Coach Feedback**: AI analysis and suggestions

#### **Data Persistence Strategy**

- **Error handling** for storage failures
- **Data validation** before persistence
- **Backup and recovery** mechanisms

  ## 🤖 AI Service & Logic Implementation

1. **Performance Metrics Calculation**
   I've developed custom algorithms to compute:

   - **Consistency Score**  
     Measures how regularly the user trains over time.

   - **Discipline Rating**  
     Evaluates user discipline based on adherence to scheduled training hours.

   - **Improvement Tracking**  
     Compares recent performance with historical data to detect progress or decline.

   - **Weekly Trends**  
     Analyzes short-term training patterns to identify fluctuations or consistency.

2. **Feedback Generation Logic**
   My AI service applies rule-based logic to:

   - Analyze user performance patterns across metrics  
   - Generate **contextual feedback messages** tailored to individual performance  
   - Suggest **specific improvement areas** based on weak metrics  
   - Offer **role-specific recommendations** (e.g., batsman vs. bowler focus)


### **Type Safety**

#### **TypeScript Interfaces**
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  age: number;
  role: 'Batsman' | 'Bowler' | 'All-Rounder' | 'Wicketkeeper';
  skillLevel: 'Beginner' | 'Intermediate' | 'Advanced';
  weeklyHours: number;
  fitnessGoal: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
